\chapter{Introduction}\label{s:intro}

We were going to call this book \emph{JavaScript for Scientists and Engineers},
but \href{https://www.dabeaz.com/}{David Beazley} thought that ``versus'' would make a better title.
While that one-word change sums up how many people view the language,
we hope we can convince you that modern JavaScript is usable as well as useful.
We changed the second half of the title because hey, data science.
We also hope that these lessons will help librarians,
digital humanists,
and everyone else who uses computing in their research,
not just scientists and engineers.

We will cover:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Core features of modern JavaScript
\item
  Programming with callbacks and promises
\item
  Creating objects and classes
\item
  Writing HTML and CSS
\item
  Creating interactive pages with React
\item
  Building data services
\item
  Testing
\item
  Data visualization
\item
  Combining everything to create a three-tier web application
\end{itemize}

Unlike most introductions to JavaScript,
these lessons present an even mix of browser programming and server programming.
We give each topic only shallow coverage;
if you want to know more,
there are many other free tutorials you can dive into once you've mastered the basics,
some of which are both up-to-date and well designed.

\section{Who You Are}\label{s:intro-personas}

Every lesson should aim to \href{http://teachtogether.tech/en/process/}{meet the needs of specific learners} \cite{Wils2018}.
The three people described below define the intended audience for this one.

\begin{description}

\item[Bhadra]
received a BSc in microbiology five years ago,
and has worked since then for a biotech firm with labs in four countries.
She did a statistics class using R as an undergrad,
then learned some more R and some Unix shell scripting
in a \href{http://software-carpentry.org/}{Software Carpentry} workshop,
but has no other training as a programmer.
Bhadra's team is developing tools
to detect structural similarities between proteins.
They would like to build a browser interface to their tools
so that people can test different algorithms on various data sets.
This book will show Bhadra how to build, test, and deploy that interface.

\item[Efraim]
did fieldwork for the Ministry of Natural Resources for thirty-one years.
He learned Visual Basic so that he could write Excel macros,
then mastered C in order to maintain the control software
for some second-hand remote sensing equipment.
Efraim recently retired,
and is now an active member of several citizen science projects.
This book will show him how to create a service
to share those projects' data with the world,
and how to build a web-based administrative interface for it.

\item[Sumi]
is completing a PhD in 19th Century history.
As part of her research,
she is transcribing and cataloging the records of several dozen Japanese-American midwives.
She has been creating and customizing WordPress sites for several years,
and has picked up bits and pieces of JavaScript while doing so.
Sumi is about to start looking for a job,
and wants to create an interactive website to showcase her research.
This book will fill in some of the gaps in her knowledge
and show her how to take advantage of JavaScript's more modern features.

\end{description}

These prototypical users:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  can write two-page programs that use lists, loops, conditionals, and functions,
\item
  can run commands in the Unix shell to navigate the filesystem and create and delete directories and files, and
\item
  have reliable access to the Internet.
\end{itemize}

\section{Setting Up}\label{s:intro-setup}

The exercises at the end of each chapter include new information
that you will need later in the book,
and are therefore not optional.
You can do the first few online,
using a service like \href{https://runkit.com/}{RunKit},
which gives you an interactive JavaScript playground in your browser.
For larger things,
and for chapters starting with the one on creating dynamic web pages (\chapref{s:dynamic}),
you should \href{https://nodejs.org/en/download/}{download and install} the latest Long-term Support (LTS) versions of Node and NPM.

\gref{g:node-js}{Node} is an open source implementation of JavaScript
that includes a command-line interpreter like those for languages such as Python and R.
The command \texttt{node} on its own starts a \gref{g:repl}{read-evaluate-print loop}
that executes commands as they are typed in and displays their output.
The command \texttt{node\ filename.js} reads and runs the commands in \texttt{filename.js};
we will see in \chapref{s:pages} how to run JavaScript in a browser.

\texttt{npm} is the Node \gref{g:package-manager}{Package Manager},
a command-line tool for finding, installing, and updating JavaScript libraries.
The command \texttt{npm\ install\ -\/-global\ library-name} (without a \texttt{.js} extension)
installs a library \gref{g:global-installation}{globally} so that all projects can use it,
while \texttt{npm\ install\ -\/-save\ library-name} installs the library \gref{g:local-installation}{locally}
(i.e., in the current project folder).
Local installation is usually a better idea,
since it isolates projects from one another.

\section{Contributing}\label{s:index-contrib}

coordinator, working on the \href{https://bio-it.embl.de}{Bio-IT Project} at
\href{https://www.embl.de}{EMBL}. He teaches a lot of courses in computing, organizes
a lot of community-building events, listens to a lot of punk rock, and
occasionally still finds time to write code and ride his bike. Toby would like
to thank his wife for her support and patience while he swore about how annoying
JavaScript is to debug.

thank everyone at \href{https://rangle.io/}{Rangle} who was so patient with him when
he was learning JavaScript.
