This lesson introduces the core features of JavaScript,
including how to run programs,
the language's basic data types,
arrays and objects,
loops,
conditionals,
functions,
and modules.
All of these concepts should be familiar if you have programmed before.

## Hello, World {#s:core-hello-world}

Use your favorite text editor to put the following line in a file called `hello.js`:

```js
console.log('hello, world')
```
{: title="src/core/hello.js"}

`console` is a built-in [module](#g:module) that provides basic printing services
(among other things).
As in many languages,
we use the [dotted notation](#g:dotted-notation) `X.Y` to get part `Y` of thing `X`---in this case,
to get `console`'s `log` function.
[Character strings](#g:string) like `'hello, world'` can be written with either single quotes or double quotes,
so long as the quotation marks match,
and semi-colons at the ends of statements are now (mostly) optional.

To run a program,
type <code>node <em>program_name.js</em></code> at the command line.
(We will preface shell commands with `$` to make them easier to spot.)

```sh
$ node src/core/hello.js
```
```text
hello, world
```

## Basic Data Types {#s:core-data-types}

JavaScript has the usual datatypes,
though unlike C, Python, and many other languages,
there is no separate type for integers:
it stores all numbers as 64-bit floating-point values,
which is accurate up to about 15 decimal digits.
We can check this using `typeof`,
which is an operator, *not* a function,
and which returns a string:

```js
const aNumber = 123.45
console.log('the type of', aNumber, 'is', typeof aNumber)
```
{: title="src/core/types.js"}
```text
the type of 123.45 is number
```

```js
const anInteger = 123
console.log('the type of', anInteger, 'is', typeof anInteger)
```
{: title="src/core/types.js"}
```text
the type of 123 is number
```

We have already met strings,
which may contain any [Unicode](#g:unicode) character:

```js
const aString = 'some text'
console.log('the type of', aString, 'is', typeof aString)
```
{: title="src/core/types.js"}
```text
the type of some text is string
```

Functions are also a type of data,
a fact whose implications we will explore in [a later lesson](./callbacks/):

```js
console.log('the type of', console.log, 'is', typeof console.log)
```
{: title="src/core/types.js"}
```text
the type of function () { [native code] } is function
```

Rather than showing the other basic types one by one,
we will put three values in a list and loop over it:

```js
const otherValues = [true, undefined, null]
for (let value of otherValues) {
  console.log('the type of', value, 'is', typeof value)
}
```
{: title="src/core/types.js"}
```text
the type of true is boolean
the type of undefined is undefined
the type of null is object
```

As the example above shows,
we use `let` to define a [variable](#g:variable)
and `const` to define a [constant](#g:constant),
put values separated by commas inside `[]` to create an [array](#g:array),
and use `for...of` to loop over the values in that array.
Note that we use `let` rather than the older `var` and `of` and not `in`:
the latter returns the indexes of the collection (e.g., 0, 1, 2),
which has some [traps for the unwary](../legacy/#iteration).
Note also that indexing starts from 0 rather than 1,
and that indentation is optional and for readability purposes only.
This may be different from the language that you're used to.

After all this,
the types themselves are somewhat anticlimactic.
JavaScript's `boolean` type can be either `true` and `false`,
though we will see below that other things can be treated as Booleans.
`undefined` means "hasn't been given a value",
while `null` means "has a value, which is nothing".

## Control Flow {#s:core-control-flow}

We have already seen `for` loops and flat arrays,
so let's have a look at conditionals and nested arrays:

```js
const values = [[0, 1], ['', 'text'], [undefined, null], [[], [2, 3]]]
for (let pair of values) {
  for (let element of pair) {
    if (element) {
      console.log(element, 'of type', typeof element, 'is truthy')
    } else {
      console.log(element, 'of type', typeof element, 'is falsy')
    }
  }
}
```
{: title="src/core/control-flow.js"}
```text
0 of type number is falsy
1 of type number is truthy
 of type string is falsy
text of type string is truthy
undefined of type undefined is falsy
null of type object is falsy
 of type object is truthy
2,3 of type object is truthy
```

This example shows that arrays are [heterogeneous](#g:heterogeneous),
i.e.,
that they can contain values of many different types
(including other arrays).
It also shows that `if` and `else` work as they do in other languages:
it's the truthiness of things that may be different.
For numbers,
0 is [falsy](#g:falsy), all others are [truthy](#g:truthy);
Similarly,
the empty string is falsy and all other strings are truthy.
`undefined` and `null` are both falsy,
as most programmers would expect.

But as the last two lines of output show,
an empty array is truthy,
which is different from its treatment in most programming languages.
The argument made by JavaScript's advocates is that an empty array is there,
it just happens to be empty,
but this behavior is still a common cause of bugs.
When testing an array,
check that `Array.length` is zero.
(Note that this is a [property](#g:property),
not a [method](#g:method),
i.e.,
it should be treated as a variable,
not called like a function.)

> **Safety Tip**
>
> Always use `===` (triple equals) and `!==` when testing for equality and inequality in JavaScript.
> `==` and `!=` do type conversion,
> which can produce some [ugly surprises](../legacy/#equality).

## Formatting Strings {#s:core-formatting}

Rather than printing multiple strings and expressions,
we can [interpolate](#g:interpolation) values into a back-quoted string.
(We have to use back quotes because this feature was added to JavaScript
long after the language was first created.)
As the example below shows,
the value to be interpolated is put in `${...}`,
and can be any valid JavaScript expression,
including a function or method call.

```js
for (let color of ['red', 'green', 'blue']) {
  const message = `color is ${color}`
  console.log(message, `and capitalized is ${color.toUpperCase()}`)
}
```
{: title="src/core/formatting.js"}
```text
color is red and capitalized is RED
color is green and capitalized is GREEN
color is blue and capitalized is BLUE
```

## Objects {#s:core-objects}

An [object](#g:object) in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs,
and is equivalent in simple cases to what Python would call a dictionary.
The keys do not have to be strings,
but almost always are;
the values can be anything.
We can create an object by putting key-value pairs in curly brackets
with colons between the keys and values
and commas between the pairs:

```js
const creature = {
  'order': 'Primates',
  'family': 'Callitrichidae',
  'genus': 'Callithrix',
  'species': 'Jacchus'
}

console.log(`creature is ${creature}`)
console.log(`creature.genus is ${creature.genus}`)
for (let key in creature) {
  console.log(`creature[${key}] is ${creature[key]}`)
}
```
{: title="src/core/objects.js"}
```text
creature is [object Object]
creature.genus is Callithrix
creature[order] is Primates
creature[family] is Callitrichidae
creature[genus] is Callithrix
creature[species] is Jacchus
```

The type of an object is always `object`.
We can get the value associated with a key using `object[key]`,
but if the key has a simple name,
we can use `object.key` instead.
Note that the square bracket form can be used with variables for keys,
but the dotted notation cannot:
i.e.,
`creature.genus` is the same as `creature['genus']`,
but the assignment `g = 'genus'` followed by `creature.g` does not work.

`[object Object]` is not particularly useful output when we want to see what an object contains.
To get a ore helpful string representation,
use `JSON.stringify(object)`:

```js
console.log(JSON.stringify(creature))
```
{: title="src/core/objects.js"}
```text
{"order":"Primates","family":"Callitrichidae","genus":"Callithrix","species":"Jacchus"}
```

Here,
"JSON" stands for "JavaScript Object Notation";
we will learn more about it [later](../interactive/).

## Functions {#s:core-functions}

```js
function limits (values) {
  if (!values.length) {
    return [undefined, undefined]
  }
  let low = values[0]
  let high = values[0]
  for (let v of values) {
    if (v < low) low = v
    if (v > high) high = v
  }
  return [low, high]
}
```
{: title="src/core/functions-classic.js"}

- Definition is:
  - Keyword `function`
  - Function name
  - Possibly-empty list of [parameters](#g:parameter) in parentheses
  - Body
- Use `return` to explicitly return a value at any time
  - If nothing returned, result is `undefined`
- Every function is a [scope](#g:scope)
  - Parameters and variables created inside function are [local](#g:local-variable)

```js
const allTests = [
  [],
  [9],
  [3, 30, 300],
  ['apple', 'Grapefruit', 'banana'],
  [3, 'apple', ['sub-array']]
]
for (let test of allTests) {
  console.log(`limits of ${test} are ${limits(test)}`)
}
```
{: title="src/core/functions-classic.js"}
```text
limits of  are ,
limits of 9 are 9,9
limits of 3,30,300 are 3,300
limits of apple,Grapefruit,banana are Grapefruit,banana
limits of 3,apple,sub-array are 3,3
```

- Generally don't write functions this way any longer
  - Interacts in odd ways with other features of the language
  - [Section on legacy issues](../legacy/#prototypes) explains why in more detail
- Instead, use [fat arrow functions](#g:fat-arrow)
  - Parameter list, `=>`, and body creates a function without a name
  - Assign that to a constant or variable

```js
const limits = (values) => {
  if (!values.length) {
    return [undefined, undefined]
  }
  let low = values[0]
  let high = values[0]
  for (let v of values) {
    if (v < low) low = v
    if (v > high) high = v
  }
  return [low, high]
}
```
{: title="src/core/functions-modern.js"}

- Same output as previous example

> **Stuck in the Past**
>
> - Why not stick to `function` and fix behavior?
> - Would break legacy programs that rely on old behavior
> - Want to make it really easy to define little functions
> - The way a language is used shapes the evolution of its syntax

## Modules {#s:core-modules}

- Want to put code in multiple files
- Unavoidable bad news is that JavaScript has several module systems
  - Node still uses CommonJS
  - But is converting to modern ES6
  - So what we use on the command line is different from what we use in the browser

```js
const bound = 3

const clip = (values) => {
  let result = []
  for (let v of values) {
    if (v <= bound) {
      result.push(v)
    }
  }
  return result
}

module.exports = {
  clip: clip
}
```
{: title="src/core/utilities.js"}

- Notes
  - Don't have to quote the keys of objects when they are simple names
  - `bound` isn't exported

```js
const utilities = require('./utilities')

const data = [-1, 5, 3, 0, 10]
const result = utilities.clip(data)
console.log(`clip(${data}) -> ${result}`)
```
{: title="src/core/import.js"}
```text
clip(-1,5,3,0,10) -> 0,1,2,3
```

- `require` returns an object
  - Keys are the names of the things the module exports
  - Values are the things (usually functions)
- Usually assign result of `require` to a variable with the same name as the module
  - Then refer to contents as `module.thing`
- Use a relative path starting with `./` or `../` to import local files
  - Paths that start with names are taken from installed Node libraries

## Exercises {#s:core-exercises}

### Typeof

What kind of thing is `typeof`?
Is it an expression?
A function?
Something else?
_Note: You might notice that `typeof typeof` is
syntactically invalid. In such circumstances, an internet search engine is your
friend. Also recommended: the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) JS reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference_

### Fill in the Blanks

Answer these questions about the program below:
so that it produces the output shown.
1. What does `Array.push` do?
1. How does a `while` loop work?
1. What does `+=` do?
1. What does `Array.reverse` do, and what does it return?

```js
let current = 0
let table = []
while (current < 5) {
  const entry = `square of ${current} is ${current * current}`
  table.push(entry)
  current += 1
}
table.reverse()
for (let line of table) {
  console.log(line)
}
```
{: title="ex/core/table-of-squares.js"}
```text
square of 4 is 16
square of 3 is 9
square of 2 is 4
square of 1 is 1
square of 0 is 0
```

### What Is Truth?

Write a function called `isTruthy` that returns `true`
for everything that JavaScript considers truthy,
and `false` for everything it considers `falsy`,
*except* empty arrays:
`isTruthy` should return `false` for those.

### Combining Different Types

What result would you expect from running the code below?
Try running it and see whether the output matched your expectations.
What are the implications of this behavior when working with real-world data?

```js
const data1 = [3, 7, 8, 9, 1]
const data2 = [0, 3, -1, "NaN", 8]

console.log(`aggregating data1`)
var total = 0
for (let d of data1) {
    total += d
}
console.log(total)

console.log(`aggregating data2`)
total = 0
for (let d of data2) {
    total += d
}
console.log(total)
```

Change one of the loops above so that the code runs through the indexes of the
array (`data1` or `data2`) instead of the values.
Does the output match your expectations this time?

### What Does This Do?

Explain what is happening in the assignment statement
that creates the constant `creature`.

```js
const genus = 'Callithrix'
const species = 'Jacchus'
const creature = {genus, species}
console.log(creature)
```
{: title="ex/core/implied.js"}
```text
{ genus: 'Callithrix', species: 'Jacchus' }
```

### What Does This Code Do?

Explain what is happening in the assignment statement in this program.
Use this technique to rewrite `src/core/import.js`
so that `clip` can be called directly as `clip(...)` rather than `utilities.clip(...)`.

```js
const creature = {
  genus: 'Callithrix',
  species: 'Jacchus'
}
const {genus, species} = creature
console.log(`genus is ${genus}`)
console.log(`species is ${species}`)
```
{: title="ex/core/destructuring.js"}

### Return to me, for my heart wants you only

```js
const verbose_sum = (first, second) => {
    console.log(`Going to add ${first} to ${second}`)
    let total = first + second
    return total
    console.log(`Finished summing`)
}

var result = verbose_sum(3, 6)
console.log(result)
```

What output would you see in the console if you ran the code above?
- Going to add ${first} to ${second}; 9
- Going to add 3 to 6; 9; Finished summing
- Going to add 3 to 6; 9
- Going to add 3 to 6; 36
