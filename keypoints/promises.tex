\begin{itemize}
\item
  JavaScript keeps an execution queue for delayed computations.
\item
  Use promises to manage delayed computation instead of raw callbacks.
\item
  Use a callback with two arguments to handle successful completion (resolve) and unsuccessful completion (reject) of a promise.
\item
  Use \texttt{then} to express the next step after successful completion and \texttt{catch} to handle errors.
\item
  Use \texttt{Promise.all} to wait for all promises in a list to complete and \texttt{Promise.race} to wait for the first promise in a set to complete.
\item
  Use \texttt{await} to wait for the result of a computation.
\item
  Mark functions that can be waited on with \texttt{async}.
\end{itemize}
