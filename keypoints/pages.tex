\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use a \texttt{meta} tag in a page's header to specify the page's character encoding.
\item
  Pages are represented in memory using a Document Object Model (DOM).
\item
  The \texttt{document} object represents the page a script is in.
\item
  Use the \texttt{querySelectorAll} method to find DOM nodes that match a condition.
\item
  Assign HTML text to a node's \texttt{innerHTML} property to change the node's content.
\item
  Use \texttt{((params)\ =\textgreater{}\ \{...\})(arguments)} to create and call a function in a single step.
\item
  An event listener is a function run by the browser when some specific event occurs.
\item
  Create an event listener for \texttt{'DOMContentLoaded'} to trigger execution of scripts \emph{after} the DOM has been constructed.
\item
  Check the \texttt{nodeType} or \texttt{nodeName} property of a DOM node to find out what kind of node it is.
\item
  Destructuring assignment allows us to assign to multiple variables by name in a single statement.
\item
  Use \texttt{setTimeout} to trigger execution of a function after a delay.
\item
  To make something run forever, have the function called by \texttt{setTimeout} set another timeout of the same function.
