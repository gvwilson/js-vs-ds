\item
  Vega-Lite is a simple way to build common visualizations.
\item
  Vega-Lite is declarative: the user creates a data structure describing what they want, and the library creates the visualization.
\item
  A Vega-Lite specification contains a schema identifier, a description, data, marks, and encodings.
\item
  The overall layout of a Vega-Lite visualization can be controlled by setting options.
\item
  Some applications will use \texttt{require} for server-side code and \texttt{import} for client-side code.
