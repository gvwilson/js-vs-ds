\begin{itemize}
\item
  Small tabular datasets are commonly stored as Comma-Separated Values (CSV).
\item
  CSV can only represent regular data, and CSV files usually don't include units.
\item
  Nested data is commonly stored using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
\item
  JSON representations of tabular data often include redundant (and therefore possibly inconsistent) specifications of column names.
\item
  PapaParse is a robust CSV parsing library that produces JSON output.
